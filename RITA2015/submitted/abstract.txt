Specifying non-functional requirements (NFRs) is a complex task, being usually dealt with on the later phases of the software process.
The late inclusion of NFRs in the development may compromise the quality of the deployed application.
This paper presents piSOD-M, a method and associated tools that (i)  allows the early specification of non-functional requirements in a principled way: users are abstracted away from low level details; (ii) embraces the MDA philosophy, generating models (code) whenever possible.
The proposed solution has been utilized in the context of an industrial and real case study.
