\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the $\pi$-SODM method an extension to the Service Oriented Development Method (SOD-M) to support the development of services software considering their functional and    non-functional requirements. 
Specifically, $\pi$-SODM proposes: 
\textit{(i)} meta-models for representing non-functional requirements in different abstraction levels; 
\textit{(ii)} model-to-model transformation rules, useful to semi-automatically refine Platform Independent Models into Platform Specific Models; and 
\textit{(iii)} rules to transform Platform Specific Models into concrete implementations. 
In order to illustrate the use of this methodology the paper describes how its use to develop a proof-of-concept.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related}
Over the last years, a number of approaches have been proposed for the
development of web services. 
These approaches range from the proposal of new 
languages for web service descriptions~\cite{bpel03,SBS04} 
to techniques to support phases of the development cycle of this kind of
software~\cite{lipari2007}. 
In general, these approaches concentrate on specific problems, like supporting transactions or
QoS, in order to improve the security and reliability of service-based
applications. 
Some proposals address service composition: workflow
definition~\cite{AalstHKB03,MuP06} or semantic equivalence between
services~\cite{BHM06}. 
%The proposed solutions come from many communities, 
%including those of Theoretical Computer Science~\cite{VA05,GGP08}, 
%Software Engineering~\cite{Aal03,MendesPDB09}, Programming
%Languages~\cite{MPC08,bpel03} and Databases~\cite{ABM01}.

Works dealing with non-functional properties in service-oriented 
development can be organized in two main groups: those working on the \textit{modeling 
of particular non-functional properties or QoS attributes} and those 
proposing \textit{architectures or frameworks to manage and 
validate QoS attributes in web service composition processes}. 
The first group considers specific non-functional concerns (e.g. security)
which is modelled and then associated to functional models of the application. 
The work of Chollet et al.~\cite{CholletL09} defines a proposal to associate non-functional 
quality properties (security properties) to functional activities in a web service composition model. Schmeling et al.~\cite{SchmelingCM11} present 
an approach and also a toolset for specifying and implementing non-functional 
concerns in web service compositions.
Non-functional concerns are modelled and then related to a service composition 
represented in a BPMN diagram. 
Ovaska et al.~\cite{OvaskaEHPA10} present an approach to 
support quality management at design time. 
Quality requirements are modelled in a first phase and then
represented in an architectural model where quality requirements are associated to some
components of the model. 

%We propose to model non-functional properties together with the modelling of functional concerns.
%We claim what this approach simplifies the web service development process. 
%Non-functional properties are represented in our work as constraints and policies 
%but more general quality model such as the proposed by~\cite{Goeb2011,Klass2009} 
%could be taken in consideration in further works. 


The second group of works dealing with non-functional requirements for services 
propose specific architectures or frameworks to manage and validate 
QoS attributes in service composition processes~\cite{XiaoCZBOLH08,Babamir2010,Karunamurthy2012787}. 
%Although our proposal focus on the design of service oriented application with non-functional 
%properties and not on the validation of QoS attributes at runtime.

Despite the variety of techniques proposed, there is not yet a consensus on a software methodology 
for web services. 
Some methodologies address the service-based 
development towards a standard or a new way to develop reliable applications. 
SOD-M and SOMF~\cite{somf} are MDD approaches for web services; 
S-Cube~\cite{scube2010book} is focused on the representation of business processes and 
service-based development; SOMA~\cite{soma} is a methodology 
for SOA solutions; 
%Extended SOA~\cite{PapazoglouH06} merges RUP and
%BPM~\cite{bpm} concepts for service modelling; 
DEVISE~\cite{DEVISE} is a
methodology for building service-based infrastructure for collaborative
enterprises. 
Other proposals include, the WIED model~\cite{TongrungrojanaL04}, 
that acts as a bridge between business modeling and design models, and traditional 
approaches for software engineering applied to SOC.
