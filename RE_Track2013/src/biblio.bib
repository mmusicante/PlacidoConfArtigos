Individual web services can be built up from Java programs.   Composed web services are built from simpler services.   PEWS operators describe the allowed workflow of the web service, \ie  the \textit{order} in which the operations of the web service   will be executed.  In this paper we analyze  the expressiveness of PEWS programs. This is done   by the systematic evaluation of the language. Our evaluation is based on a   framework composed by workflow patterns. We also compare PEWS with other   interface description languages. This comparison is based on the workflow   behavior of the languages.  ",
