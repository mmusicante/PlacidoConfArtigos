While Functional Requirements establish \textit{what} is computed by an application, Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are concerned with \textit{how} the task is preformed.  
NFRs include aspects such as performance, authentication and quality constraints.
Non-functional properties are also referred to as constraints, quality attributesÄù, quality goalsÄù, quality of service requirements and Äúnon-behavioural requirementsÄù \cite{StGr05}. 
In the case of service-based applications, non-functional requirements concern the application itself as well as its component services. 
%The majority of the works on NFPs focus on measuring in which extent a software system  fulfills the NFPs that it should satisfy \cite{BBKL78,FePf96,KiDa96,Lyu96,MuIO90}. 
Most research on NFRs focus on the evaluation of compliance by the software system. 

In~\cite{Babamir2010,Yeom2006} non-functional properties of web services are classified according to three points of view, namely,  
\textit{service level}, \textit{system level} and \textit{business level}.
In~\cite{Babamir2010} NFRs are denoted as \textit{quality constraints}, which are expressed as logic formulae.
In~\cite{Yeom2006} authors classify NFRs into \textit{category}, \textit{sub-category} and \textit{property}. Categories include \textit{business}, \textit{service} and \textit{system}.
Possible \textit{sub-categories} are \textit{security}, \textit{value} or  \textit{interoperability}. The work also defines a \textit{web service quality model}, which considers non-functional properties. 

In~\cite{XiaoCZBOLH08} the authors use the terms  
\textit{non-functional attributes}, \textit{composition mo\-del entity} and \textit{mo\-del entity}  to classify different concepts related to NFRs.
The notion of non-functional attribute is used to describe NFRs of the abstract process model. In the lower level, the composition is annotated with non-functional attributes.

D'Ambrogio~\cite{DAmbrogio06} uses the term \textit{quality category} to group similar \textit{quality characteristics}. 
\textit{Quality dimensions} are used to quantify an individual characteristic.
For instance, the quality category \textit{performance} groups characteristics such as
\textit{latency} and \textit{throughput}. 
The development process is based on MDA and the authors also present a WSDL extension for describing the QoS of web services. A catalog of \textit{QoS characteristics} is provided for the web service domain, including properties as \textit{availability}, \textit{reliability} and \textit{access control}. 

 
Schmeling et al.~\cite{SchmelingCM11} present an approach and a toolset for specifying and implementing web service compositions with support to several NFRs. The term \textit{non-functional concern} (NFC) is used to denote  NFRs. 
%Two aspects are considered: specification and realization.
\textit{Non-functional concern} is a general term used to describe non-functional requirements. 
For instance, \textit{security}, \textit{reliability}, \textit{transactional behavior} are non-functional requirements. 
A \textit{non-functional action} represents some behavior that implements \textit{non-functional attributes}. 
An example of \textit{non-functional action} is \textit{encryption}, which provides the implementation of the \textit{non-functional attribute} \textit{confidentiality}. 
Non-functional actions related to a common concern are grouped into \textit{non-functional activities}. 

Pastrana et al.~\cite{PastranaPK11} use the term \textit{contract} to describe non-functional requirements. 
\textit{Contracts} may have pre-conditions, post-conditions and invariants. 
Each contract defines \textit{assertions} associated with \textit{quality properties}. 
Each service may have as many associated \textit{contracts} as needed.

Chollet et al.~\cite{CholletL09} associate (non-functional) \textit{quality properties} to 
(functional) activities. The authors present a security meta-model for web service
composition. The NFRs considered are \textit{authentication}, \textit{integrity} and \textit{confidentiality}. 
Each NFR is associated with a service activity.


Ceri et al.\cite{CeriDMF07} uses the notions of \textit{policy}, \textit{rule}, \textit{condition} and \textit{action model} to specify NFRs.
Agarwal et al.~\cite{AgarwalLS09} associate \textit{service policies} to services. 
Each service may also have \textit{properties}, such as \textit{security} and \textit{reliability}. 
Ovaska et al.~\cite{OvaskaEHPA10} use the terms \textit{quality attribute}, \textit{category}, \textit{conceptual layer} and \textit{importance} to organize and classify NFRs.
Other authors do not define specific terms to refer to NFRs. 
They use terms such as \textit{attribute}~\cite{ZhangPSP05,BasinDL06,JeongCL09}, 
\textit{property}~\cite{Fabra2011}, 
\textit{factor}~\cite{MohantyRP10,GutierrezRF10}, 
\textit{characteristic}~\cite{DiamadopoulouMPS08}, 
\textit{quality level}~\cite{ModicaTV09}, and
\textit{value}~\cite{ThissenW06,BasinDL06}.


Despite of the different notations found in the literature for classifying NFRs, some non-functional requirements are frequently considered, such as \textit{security}, \textit{performance}, \textit{reliability}, \textit{usability}, and \textit{availability}.
However, distinct hierarchies and models are proposed for NFRs,  according to different points of view.
We have identified a number of approaches~\cite{DAmbrogio06,CholletL09,SchmelingCM11,BasinDL06,Fabra2011,OvaskaEHPA10} that use MDD (Model Driven Development) for designing and developing applications. 

Fabra \textit{et al.}~\cite{Fabra2011} also describes the importance of  MDD for service-oriented applications. This work  presents a complete development methodology, although this methodology is not centered on NFRs.
The authors in~\cite{ThissenW06,ZhangPSP05} use formal methods to define a service-based development process that takes NFRs into account. 
In~\cite{AgarwalLS09,PastranaPK11} ontologies are used to define and model NFRs, 
whereas in~\cite{XiaoCZBOLH08,GutierrezRF10} Business Process Modeling (BPM) is used for
system specification, including NFRs. 
The majority of the authors concentrate on the  modeling of service compositions, although a significant number of approaches is focused on the definition of NFR models.


In the method defined in~\cite{XiaoCZBOLH08}, tasks in the process model can be 
annotated with \textit{non-functional attributes} (NFAs). 
NFAs are defined apart  and are concerned with data items or tasks. 
NFAs for data considers \textit{value} and \textit{range}, whereas NFAs for tasks include \textit{cost}, \textit{time}, \textit{resources} and \textit{expressions}.

The proposal in~\cite{ThissenW06} presents steps for  selecting services 
by taking QoS information into account. The proposed steps are: 
\textit{(i)} identification of relevant QoS information; 
\textit{(ii)} identification of basic composition patterns and 
QoS aggregation rules for these patterns; and 
\textit{(iii)} definition of a selection mechanism of services. 
The QoS properties considered are \textit{performance}, \textit{cost}, \textit{reliability} and
\textit{availability}. 
  
Karunamurthy et al.~\cite{Karunamurthy2012787} use the term \textit{non-function parameters} to define NFRs, such as \textit{cost}, \textit{response time}, \textit{availability}, \textit{security}, \textit{reliability} and \textit{reputation}.  
The \textit{Non-Func\-tion\-al Specification Language} (NFSL) is proposed as a domain specific language (DSL) to express \textit{non-function parameters}.

Liu et al.~\cite{Liu20121080} use the term \textit{QoS parameter} to describe non-functional requirements such as \textit{cost}, \textit{execution duration}, \textit{accuracy}, \textit{security}, \textit{integrity}, \textit{availability} and \textit{reliability}.  
In the same way, Tran et al.~\cite{Tran2012531} use the term \textit{QoS policies} to classify similar non-functional requirements.

Li et al.~\cite{Li2013} associate \textit{dimensions} to  \textit{QoS parameters} to classify NFRs.  
For instance, the \textit{time} dimension is associated to the \textit{execution time} and \textit{communication time} parameters; the \textit{spatial} dimension is associated to the \textit{storage capacity} and \textit{message length} parameters; the \textit{reliability} dimension is associated to the \textit{availability} and \textit{reliability} parameters and the \textit{cost} dimension is associated to the \textit{service cost} parameter.
Rumpel et al.~\cite{Rumpel2012}  associate \textit{quality requirements} to  \textit{quality properties}. Quality requirements are intended to be specified as constraints. 

\bigskip
Most works agree on distinguishing three points of view, namely the point of view of the organization (or Business view), of the individual service providers (or Service view) and of the composition designer (or System view).
The Business view is concerned with the business logic (\textit{i.e.}, an abstract level of tasks, defined by the guidelines and constraints imposed by the organization).
Service and System views are concerned with the implementation of the software solution: The Service level is concerned with the building blocks of the application.
It may use web services provided by third party sources.
The System level is concerned with the coordination of services, to implement the business logic.
