	distributed, enterprise-wide applications. We present a scalable,
	rigorously founded approach to enterprise-wide workflow management,
	based on the distributed execution of state and activity charts.
	By exploiting the formal semantics of state and activity charts,
	we develop an algorithm for transforming a centralized state and
	activity chart into a provably equivalent partitioned one, suitable
	for distributed execution. A synchronization scheme is developed
	that guarantees an execution equivalent to a non-distributed one.
	This basic solution is further refined in order to reduce communication
	overhead and exploit parallelism between partitions whenever possible.
	The developed synchronization schemes are compared in terms of the
	number and size of synchronization messages},
