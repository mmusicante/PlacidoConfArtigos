  abstract = {PEWS is a language for the implementation of web service interfaces.
	PEWS programs can be used for the description of both individual
	and composed web services. Individual web services can be built up
	from Java programs. Composed web services are built from simpler
	services. PEWS operators describe the allowed workflow of the web
	service, \ie the \textit{order} in which the operations of the web
	service will be executed. In this paper we analyze the expressiveness
	of PEWS programs. This is done by the systematic evaluation of the
	language. Our evaluation is based on a framework composed by workflow
	patterns. We also compare PEWS with other interface description languages.
	This comparison is based on the workflow behavior of the languages.
